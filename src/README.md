# ASPC Website 2.0

This repo is intended to be a complete rewrite of [pomonastudents.org](https://pomonastudents.org) (formerly [aspc.pomona.edu](http://aspc.pomona.edu)). The aim of this project is to:
 - Put the content that most people use front and center
 - Redesign the website from the ground up
 - Streamline and trim legacy features

## Development
This repo is run and maintained by the ASPC Software Development Group, but anyone may contribute to this repository!
If you attend Pomona College or any of the other Claremont Colleges and would like to join, please feel free to reach out to us at software@aspc.pomona.edu.
