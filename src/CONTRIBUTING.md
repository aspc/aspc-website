## Development WorkFlow
The high-level development workflow looks something like this:

- Checkout a branch from `master`
- Make a pull request

### Branch naming conventions
Check out a branch from **master**, our PR base branch. When naming a branch, we try to adhere to the following conventions:

- ***feature/#NUMBER-[FEATURE-NAME]*** for new features
- ***hotfix/#NUMBER-[BUG-NAME]*** for bug fixes

where **#NUMBER** corresponds to the number of the related bug or feature request created via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/aspc/aspc-website/issues)
