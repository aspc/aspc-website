  <strong>Need help finding roommates for Spring 2021?</strong> The ASPC Housing Platform can help you connect with
  other students
  seeking Spring housing! Click the link under "Add a New Listing" to let others know whom you are looking for, and use
  the directory under "Current Listings" to find students who might fit your bill. Completing both steps (and
  consistently checking the directory) will help you find roommates most efficiently.
</p>

<p class="margin-bottom-1">
  This resource is available to you regardless what stage of planning you are in: whether you represent a group that has
  found housing and is seeking to fill some rooms, or whether you are an individual student seeking to join others.
  Contact <a href="mailto:operations@aspc.pomona.edu">operations@aspc.pomona.edu</a> with any questions.
</p>

<p class="margin-bottom-1">
  If you would like to have your listing removed, email
  <a href="operations@aspc.pomona.edu">operations@aspc.pomona.edu</a> with the subject line: "Delete
  Housing Listing". Please allow 2-3 business days for your request to be processed.

  <strong>Note</strong>: As of the day this platform is released (11/18/20), ASPC is not aware of final details
  regarding the Spring 2021 semester, including how many students the college plans to bring on campus. The purpose of
  this platform is to support any students who have decided to seek remote housing regardless. Please be safe when
  finding remote housing and follow all public health guidelines concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.
